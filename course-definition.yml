        I spent a full day on your Docker building course and ended up building the whole thing myself. As a SRE (and
        mostly a user of docker), digging into the internals blew me away.

        CodeCrafters has you build your own version of things like Git and Docker from scratch. A cool way to build a stronger mental model of how those tools work.

stages:
  - slug: "init"
    name: "Execute a program"
    difficulty: very_easy
    description_md: |-
      Your task is to implement a very basic version 
      of [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/)</a>. It will
      be executed similar to `docker run`:

      ```
      mydocker run ubuntu:latest /usr/local/bin/docker-explorer echo hey
      ```

      [docker-explorer](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/docker-explorer) is a custom test program that exposes
      commands like `echo` and `ls`.

      For now, don't worry about pulling the `ubuntu:latest` image. We will just
      execute a local program for this stage and print its output. You'll work on 
      pulling images from Docker Hub in stage 6.
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll execute a program using `fork` + `exec`.
    tester_source_code_url: "https://github.com/codecrafters-io/docker-tester/blob/18245703a5beed8ee0a7e1cbb7204a7ee3b3b5d1/internal/stage_basic_exec.go#L9"

  - slug: "stdio"
    name: "Wireup stdout & stderr"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      You'll now pipe the program's stdout and stderr to the
      parent process.

      Like the last stage, the tester will run your program like this:

      ```
      mydocker run ubuntu:latest /usr/local/bin/docker-explorer echo hey
      ```

      To test this behaviour locally, you could use the `echo` + `echo_stderr`
      commands that `docker-explorer` exposes. Run `docker-explorer --help` to
      view usage.

      If you've got any logs or print statements in your code, make sure to remove
      them. The tester can't differentiate between debug logs and the actual
      output!

      Note: The **README** in your repository contains setup
      information for this stage and beyond (takes < 5 min).
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll relay the child program's stdout & stderr to the
      parent process.
    tester_source_code_url: "https://github.com/codecrafters-io/docker-tester/blob/18245703a5beed8ee0a7e1cbb7204a7ee3b3b5d1/internal/stage_stdio.go#L9"

  - slug: "exit_code"
    name: "Handle exit codes"
    difficulty: easy
    description_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll need to relay the program's exit code to the parent
      process.

      If the program you're executing exits with exit code 1, your program
      should exit with exit code 1 too.

      To test this behaviour locally, you could use the `exit` command that
      `docker-explorer` exposes. Run `docker-explorer --help` to view usage.

      Just like the previous stage, the tester will run your program like this:

      ```
      mydocker run ubuntu:latest /usr/local/bin/docker-explorer exit 1
      ```
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll wait for the child program's exit code and exit with
      it.
    tester_source_code_url: "https://github.com/codecrafters-io/docker-tester/blob/18245703a5beed8ee0a7e1cbb7204a7ee3b3b5d1/internal/stage_exit_code.go#L9"

  - slug: "fs_isolation"
    name: "Filesystem isolation"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |-
      In the previous stage, we executed a program that existed locally on our
      machine. This program had write access to the whole filesystem, which
      means that it could do **dangerous** things!

      In this stage, you'll use [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot)
      to ensure that the program you execute doesn't have access to any files on
      the host machine. Create an empty temporary directory and `chroot` into it
      when executing the command. You'll need to copy the binary being executed
      too.

      {{#lang_is_rust}}
      At the time of writing this, the implementation of chroot in Rust's standard library
      ([std::os::unix::fs::chroot](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/os/unix/fs/fn.chroot.html)) is still a
      nightly-only experimental API. We've included [libc](https://crates.io/crates/libc) as a dependency
      instead.
      {{/lang_is_rust}}

      {{#lang_is_nim}}
      Since Nim's [posix module](https://nim-lang.org/docs/posix.html) doesn't
      have `chroot` defined, you'll need to implement this yourself! For
      examples on how to do this, view the source for other syscalls like
      [chdir](https://nim-lang.org/docs/posix.html#chdir%2Ccstring).
      {{/lang_is_nim}}

      {{#lang_is_go}}
      When executing your program within the chroot directory, you might run into an error that says
      `open /dev/null: no such file or directory`. This is because [Cmd.Run()](https://golang.org/pkg/os/exec/#Cmd.Run)
      and its siblings expect `/dev/null` to be present. You can work around this by either creating an empty
      `/dev/null` file inside the chroot directory, or by ensuring that `Cmd.Stdout`, `Cmd.Stderr` and `Cmd.Stdin` are not `nil`.
      More details about this [here](https://rohitpaulk.com/articles/cmd-run-dev-null).
      {{/lang_is_go}}

      {{#lang_is_rust}}
      When executing your program within the chroot directory, you might run into an error that says
      `no such file or directory` even if the binary exists within the chroot. This is because
      [Command::output()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/process/struct.Command.html#method.output)
      expects `/dev/null` to be present. You can work around this by creating an empty
      `/dev/null` file inside the chroot directory. This cryptic error effects Go programs too, more details
      [here](https://rohitpaulk.com/articles/cmd-run-dev-null).
      {{/lang_is_rust}}

      Just like the previous stage, the tester will run your program like this:

      ```
      mydocker run ubuntu:latest /usr/local/bin/docker-explorer ls /some_dir
      ```
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll restrict a program's access to the host filesystem
      by using [chroot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot).
    tester_source_code_url: "https://github.com/codecrafters-io/docker-tester/blob/18245703a5beed8ee0a7e1cbb7204a7ee3b3b5d1/internal/stage_fs_isolation.go#L8"

  - slug: "process_isolation"
    name: "Process isolation"
    difficulty: medium
    description_md: |-
      In the previous stage, we guarded against malicious activity by
      restricting an executable's access to the filesystem.

      There's another resource that needs to be guarded: the process tree. The
      process you're executing is currently capable of viewing all other
      processes running on the host system, and sending signals to them.

      In this stage, you'll use [PID
      namespaces](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html) to
      ensure that the program you execute has its own isolated process tree.
      The process being executed must see itself as PID 1.

      {{#lang_is_php}}
      You'll need to use the `pcntl_unshare` function for this, which was
      [added in PHP 7.4](https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration74.new-functions.php), and isn't properly documented
      yet (as of 22 Jan 2021). Here's the [pull request](https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/3760) where it was added.
      {{/lang_is_php}}

      Just like the previous stage, the tester will run your program like this:

      ```
      mydocker run ubuntu:latest /usr/local/bin/docker-explorer mypid
      ```
    marketing_md: |-
      In this stage, you'll restrict a program's access to the host's process
      tree by using [PID
      namespaces](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/pid_namespaces.7.html).
    tester_source_code_url: "https://github.com/codecrafters-io/docker-tester/blob/18245703a5beed8ee0a7e1cbb7204a7ee3b3b5d1/internal/stage_process_isolation.go#L5"

  - slug: "fetch_from_registry"
    name: "Fetch an image from the Docker Registry"
    difficulty: hard
    description_md: |-
      Your docker implementation can now execute a program with a fair degree of
      isolation - it can't modify files or interact with processes running on
      the host.

      In this stage, you'll use [the Docker registry
      API](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/) to fetch the contents of
      a public image on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and then execute a
      command within it.

      You'll need to:

      - Do a small [authentication dance](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/auth/token/)
      - Fetch the [image manifest](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#pulling-an-image-manifest)
      - [Pull layers](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/#pulling-a-layer) of an image and extract them to the chroot directory

      The base URL for Docker Hub's public registry is `registry.hub.docker.com`.

      The tester will run your program like this:

      ```
      mydocker run ubuntu:latest /bin/echo hey
      ```

      The image used will be an [official
      image](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/official_images/) from Docker
      Hub. For example: [`alpine:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine),
      [`ubuntu:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu),
      [`busybox:latest`](https://hub.docker.com/_/busybox). When interacting with the
      Registry API, you'll need to prepend `library/` to the image names.

      {{#lang_is_rust}}
      Since Rust doesn't have an archive extraction utility in its stdlib, you
      might want to shell out and use `tar`.

      You can use the [reqwest](https://crates.io/crates/reqwest) crate to make
      HTTP requests, we've included it in the `Cargo.toml` file. We've also included
      [serde_json](https://crates.io/crates/serde_json) to help with parsing JSON.
